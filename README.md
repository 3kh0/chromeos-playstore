# ChromeOS Play store bypass

This bypass can get you a completely unblocked Playstore.

## Instructions

**NOTE:**
This only works if you can downgrade to version 81 and if the Playstore is enabled on your Chromebook. If your Chromebook updates you will lose access to the unblocked Playstore but will keep the apps you initially downloaded.

GUIDE:

1. Downgrade to version 81. If you need help with that refer to [chrome100.dev](https://chrome100.dev). [More help here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NCXDfjsBVDSR3JrpRXy4C-jz48mkIFaBVntpcbnJX_0/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Once the Playstore downloads open Settings, click on "Apps", the arrow next to where it says "Google Playstore", and then "Manage Android Preferences"
3. Click on Accounts and add your PERSONAL email
4. Open the Playstore and click on the 3 lines in the top left corner. Select the account you just added and have fun
